# cloud-debug.sh — fetch a GCP resource's recent ERROR logs and hand them to
# Antigravity (`agy` / Gemini) for a compact, structured digest.
# Part of the "Antigravity for Claude Code" plugin.
#
# This is the Executor half of the /antigravity:cloud-run-debug command:
# Claude (the Conductor) reasons about root cause + the fix; the bulk, cheap
# work — pulling potentially hundreds of log lines and clustering them into a
# digest — is offloaded here to agy so Claude's context stays lean.
#
# It is deliberately READ-ONLY: it reads logs and produces a digest. It never
# applies fixes and never writes to your project (the `--apply` flow lives in
# the command, driven by Claude on a branch). The default resource type is
# Cloud Run (cloud_run_revision); `--resource-type` is parameterized so the
# same engine can back a future gke-debug / functions-debug without a rewrite.
#
# The agy digest step reuses scripts/agy-delegate.sh (the plugin's one
# delegation wrapper) — no new delegation logic here.
#
# Usage:
#   cloud-debug.sh --service <name> [options]
#
# Options:
#   -s, --service <name>           Cloud Run service name (required)
#   -r, --region  <r>             Location/region (omit to query all regions)
#       --since <dur>             Log freshness window, e.g. 1h, 30m, 2d (default: 1h)
#       --limit <n>              Max log entries to fetch (default: 200)
#       --severity <SEV>         Minimum severity (default: ERROR)
#       --resource-type <type>    GCP resource.type (default: cloud_run_revision)
#   -p, --project <id>           GCP project (default: gcloud config's project)
#   -t, --tier <flash|flash-lo|pro>  agy tier for the digest (default: flash)
#       --print-command          Print the resolved gcloud + agy commands and exit (dry run)
#   -h, --help                   Show this help
#
# Environment:
#   CLOUD_DEBUG_MAX_BYTES        Cap (bytes) on the log payload handed to agy (default: 200000).
#                                Past this the tail is clipped and agy is told the digest may be partial.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  ok (digest printed, or query succeeded with no matching logs)
#   1  usage error
#   2  gcloud read failed (generic)
#   3  permission denied — needs roles/logging.viewer (guidance printed)
#   4  gcloud not on PATH
#   5  agy digest step failed (agy-delegate stderr is surfaced)

You are a log-analysis assistant. Below is a JSON array of GCP log entries at
the requested severity or higher. Produce a COMPACT, structured digest — do NOT
echo the raw logs back. Use exactly these sections:

## ERROR CLUSTERS
Group entries by error signature (normalize variable bits like ids, hashes,
timestamps). For each cluster give: a one-line label, the count, and first/last
seen time.

## REPRESENTATIVE STACK TRACE(S)
For the top 1-3 clusters, the single most representative stack trace or error
message, trimmed to the relevant frames.

## TIME DISTRIBUTION
One or two lines: were the errors bursty or steady? any spike, and when?

## LIKELY ROOT-CAUSE CANDIDATES
2-5 ranked hypotheses, each one line, naming which cluster supports it
(e.g. missing env var, unhandled exception, bad config, dependency/timeout).

Be concise. Output ONLY the digest.
